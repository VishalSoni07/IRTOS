A prototype of a website improving chances of booking a reserved ticket on Indian Railways.

What- Its a website to increase the chances of booking a reservation seat in train tickets.
Why- In our indian railway ticket booking site, we don't have the liberty to search a reservation between more than two stations in single search. (If asked for example)For example, suppose we want to go from Bangalore to Mumbai,and we are not getting reservation for the same then we can try with other stations like Mysore, Tumkur in source and Pune, Kalyan in destination, and do the search with them. So he can book the ticket from Mysore(if available) and can keep the boarding point at Bangalore.
How- So our website takes 5 source and 5 destination stations from the user in priority order, so instead of having one query result in one search we can get 25 results, by searching each source with all other destination.
